          <h3>Beginning of Stüssy</h3>
          <div class="textbox">
            <p class="ko">
              Stüssy의 창립자인 Shawn Stüssy는 캘리포니아 라구나 비치에서
              친구들과 현지인들을 위해 자신만의 보드를 만들곤 했던 서퍼였습니다. <br>
              Stüsy는 홍보의 한 형태로 서핑보드와 함께 판매하기 위한 티셔츠와 반바지를 판매하기 시작했고,
              그렇게 판매된 옷들은 서핑과 스케이트보드를 좋아하던 사람들 사이에 인기를 끌게 되었습니다.
            </p>

              Shawn Stüssy was a surfer who used to shape his own boards for friends and locals in Laguna Beach, California. 
              Stüssy began screening t-shirts and shorts to sell along with the surfboards as a form of promotion;
             <!--  his surname written in a graffiti-influenced hand style was to become the company logo.  -->
              Stüssy inadvertently fell into the clothing business through his deep-rooted love of surfing, 
              and in a few short years, people were talking within the small, insular world of surf and skateboarding in the late 
              ‘80s. Shawn set up small showrooms in New York and California and hit the road, showing his designs to stores he respected.

            <p class="ko">
              Stüssy는 대중 문화에 획기적인 변화를 주었던 펑크와 랩이 생기기 시작할 때 함께 성장했습니다.<br>
              펑크의 창조적이고 미적인 장벽을 깨고 누구나 밴드를 가질 수 있다는 배움과
              랩의 사회적 경계를 넓히는 리믹스와 샘플링의 아이디어는
              Stüssy의 디자인과 문화적 표현에 영향을 주었고
              이러한 디자인은 서핑 문화, 스케이트, 음악를
              사랑하는 사람들 사이에서 관심을 받기 시작했습니다.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="en">
              The brand grew during a time when epochal shifts that now frame contemporary popular culture were taking place.
               In the music scene the late ’70s gave us punk, while the early ’80s brought us a new DIY type of music called rap. 
               Punk broke creative and aesthetic barriers and taught us that anyone could have a band. 
               <!-- Rap pushed social boundaries and explored the ideas of remixing and sampling.  -->
              <!--  These new ideas and territories created a new modern platform for fashion and cultural expression.  -->
               The designs and overall aesthetic touched on references from a range of underground subcultures that resonated with Stüssy. 
               <!-- This approach appealed to a worldwide network of creative youth who shared a common interest in surf-culture, skating and music.  -->
               Limited distribution fuelled the desire internationally, and those who wanted the gear found it and felt a part of something bigger in the process.

          <h3>Development of Stüssy</h3>
          <div class="textbox">
            <p class="ko">
              Stüssy의 옷은 비슷한 취향을 가진 음악가, 스케이트 선수, 예술가들로 구성된 국제적인 그룹에서 영감을 받았고
              그 그룹들과 여행하며 Stüssy를 세계에 알리게 되었습니다.<br>
              이후, Stüssy 브랜드는 한정된 수량으로 전 세계의 엄선된 매장에서만 구입할 수 있는
              합리적인 가격에 품질이 좋은 의류를 생산하기 위해 노력하고 있습니다.<br>
            </p>
            <p class="en">
              With Stüssy's success came the opportunity to travel and spread the Stüssy vibe.
               The clothing was inspired by an international group of musicians, skaters, DJs and artists with similar tastes;
              <!--   trendsetters in New York, London, Tokyo and other areas of the world were eager to get aboard this movement inspired 
                by a network of like-minded individuals. 
                This group of friends later became the “International Stüssy Tribe” with chapters in New York,
                 Tokyo, London, Berlin and Los Angeles. -->
                  With a strong network of tribe members wearing the brand in clubs and on the scene across the globe, 
                  the Stüssy message spread organically. 
                  The brand was committed to producing relevant, 
                  good quality clothing at a reasonable price available only at very select stores worldwide in limited quantities.
                   This was an entirely new concept at the time, which has since been used to varying degrees of success.
